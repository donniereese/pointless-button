# Pointless Button
Create, share and interact with pointless buttons and switches.
Who doesn't like a satisfying toggle, anyways?

### Description
Buttons, switches, toggles, sliders...
They're all ways we've interacted with our technology. They are easy to use and understand. The idea of physical input is context. Pointless Button is designed to allow people to easily create these togglable, interactive intents and define context around them. It doesn't assume how a user would want to represent this imput. API endpoints, links, visual input; It's all up to the creator.
